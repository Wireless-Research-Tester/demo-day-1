# demo-day1

Project Title: Senior Design Demo Day 1
    
    GUI Built with PyQt5.
    
    In the current state of the project the user interface will lead the user through a 
    sample of a typical program flow. For the first Demo day some of the funcitons will
    be implemented with dummy data. The main purpose of this code is to be a demonstration 
    of how the program works and to lay the foundation to futher conrol. 

    To collaborate follow the git flow construct.

    In order to keep the project organized, Layer the files based on function. The UIskeleton
    directory holds all the files associated with the user. The code that primarily deals the 
    underlying functionality like vna coms, positioner functions and graphing should be added 
    to a seperate  folder. By keeping the project layered we can collaborate better and reduce merge 
    conflicts.

    from stack overflow: 
   
a 3 tier Architecture is composed by 3 Main Layers
PL Presentation Layer
BLL Business Logic Layer
DAL Data Access Layer
each top layer only asks the below layer and never sees anything on top of it.
